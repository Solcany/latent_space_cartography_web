#### What is latent space?

Latent space can be thought of as the imagination of a generative neural network such as [StyleGAN3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zaGYLPj4Kk) that can synthesise photo realistic potraits of non existing people. These networks are trained on existing images to generate artificial images resembling the real ones. The space into which these networks inscribe their understanding of images is the latent space.

Initially this space has no meaning, it is the particular training data and the setup of the network that interpret the latent space and thus give it meaning. In the context of neural networks each latent space is unique. These networks create endlessly varying landscapes of imagery for which latent spaces serve as the source of inspiration.

#### Walking in latent gardens

The goal of this project is develop intuitive ways to explore and navigate these imagination landscapes. Over the course of next 6 months I will create a series of prototypical interfaces and data visualisations for intuitive exploration of latent spaces and the artificial images they create. 

My aim is to create experiences similar to a walk in the garden instead of a tool for analytical observations of latent spaces. I draw inspiration from experimental video games, interactive data visualizations and non-linear interactive fiction. This website serves as the journal for documenting this journey.
