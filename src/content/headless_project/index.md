**This website is dedicated to the 6 months long artistic research project Latent Space Cartography. The purpose of this website is to track the progress of the project and present the outputs. This project is work of Matus Solcany, for questions please reach out at matus.solcany@protonmail.com . This project is made possible with the support of Stimuleringsfonds.**

These networks are often presented and perceived through individual images they generate. In this project I will focus on representing the entire imagination space of a generative network. How can this numerical space be navigated meaningfully? Can this space be represented metaphorically as a forest, a labyrinth or a synthetic gallery?

During the development of these prototypes I will draw inspiration from experimental video games, interactive data visualizations and non-linear interactive fiction.
