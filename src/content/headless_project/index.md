#### What is latent space?

Latent space can be thought of as the imagination of a  generative neural network such as [StyleGAN3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zaGYLPj4Kk) that creates photo realistic potraits of non existing people.

It is the space into which a neural network inscribes its understanding of images it is trained on. And from which this network gathers inspiration for new imagery.

Initially this space has no meaning, it is the particular training data andthe network and that interpret the latent space and give it meaning. In the context of neural networks each latent space is unique.

#### Why explore latent spaces?

Generative neural networks are used to create [artworks](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18013190/ai-art-portrait-auction-christies-belamy-obvious-robbie-barrat-gans), [artificial personalities](https://www.rosebud.ai/humansofai) and [artificial realities](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/11/1026135/ai-synthetic-data/) for other AIs to learn from. These networks often perceived through the individual images they create. But what distinguishes them from the creative techniques of the past is the infinite variation of the images they create.

Can the implications of this new method of creation be discussed without having a grasp on the space from which these creation come?

This project is an attempt to develop a visual understanding of the entire imagination of a generative neural network by visualising and exploring the latent space. 

What is the meaning of a region, a border, distance and direction in Latent space? Can the techniques of cartography be used to map this space?

#### How to explore latent spaces?

Over the course of next 6 months I aim to develop a series of prototypical interfaces for developing my intuition for the sense of scale, direction and navigation of latent spaces. I draw inspiration experimental video games, interactive data visualizations and non-linear interactive fiction. This website serves as a journal for documenting this journey.
