#### What is latent space?

Latent space can be thought of as the imagination of a  generative neural network such as [StyleGAN3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zaGYLPj4Kk) that can synthesise photo realistic potraits of non existing people.

It is the space into which a neural network inscribes its understanding of images it is trained on. Once the network is trained on real imagery it draws inspiration from this space to create new artificial images.

Initially this space has no meaning, it is the particular training data and the setup of the network that interpret the latent space and thus give it meaning. In the context of neural networks each latent space is unique.

#### Why explore latent spaces?

Generative neural networks are used to create [artworks](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18013190/ai-art-portrait-auction-christies-belamy-obvious-robbie-barrat-gans), [artificial personalities](https://www.rosebud.ai/humansofai) and [artificial realities](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/11/1026135/ai-synthetic-data/) for other AIs to learn from. 

These networks shift the position of human creator from working direcetly on an artwork towards indirect curation of generated visual material. These networks create endlessly varying landscapes of visual material. Yet they are perceived through particular hand picked images they create.

This project's goal is to develop visual understanding of the entire imagination space of generative neural networks by visualising and exploring their latent spaces. 


#### The project goals

Over the course of next 6 months I will develop a series of prototypical interfaces and data visualisations for developing my understanding of latent spaces. Are traditional cartographical techniques relevant in this statistical space? What is the meaning of a region, a border, distance and direction in Latent space?

I draw inspiration from experimental video games, interactive data visualizations and non-linear interactive fiction. This website serves as a journal for documenting this journey.
