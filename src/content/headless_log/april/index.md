I've been experimenting with different image generating networks in since January, I felt like the images from the portrait network weren't very interesting. 

I tried training a new one from scratch and customised some existing ones. I realised that a well trained image network and means to explore the latent space of one are two separate projects. I feel somewhat burnt out at this point. I'll be working with existing networks from now on.
