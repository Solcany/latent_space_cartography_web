#### The goals for February

Most of the prototypes I've made so far are all using pretrained image generators. These are usually trained on single class of data: painted portraits, portrait photographs, flowers, animals and so on. I'm curious to see if a generator can be simultenously trained on for example painted portraits and flowers and create images that resemble both portraits and flowers.

In February I'll be training a generator with a multi class dataset. With a lot of technical issues out of the way and the engine working, I'm hoping spend more time exploring the conceptual possibilities of these prototypes.
