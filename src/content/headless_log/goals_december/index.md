#### Goals for December

The goal for december is to develop a tool to be used as the foundation for the navigational prototypes. 

This tool will generate images, preserve the multidimensional latent noise and visualise the images and the noise in 3d space. 

Initially I imagined that these navigational prototypes would be metaphorically based on submarines, boats and planes. But after discussions with friends I'm reconsidering to use these prototypes to explore concepts like direction, distance, region and boundary in the context of latent spaces.
