### Metaphorical representationâ€¨

Spending the day coming up with space metaphors for representation of multi dimensional statistical space that i can easily implement and experiment with. If the metaphor is Labirynth what can layout of labirynth reveal about a latent space? How will the navigation limitations of Labirynth affect the insights about the contents of the latent space? What if the metaphors is a forest or an artificial museum?

### Non metaphorical representation

Is metaphor necessary? What if instead of a metaphorical representation i start with an abstract data visualization with umap or something like that? What does a metaphor add?
