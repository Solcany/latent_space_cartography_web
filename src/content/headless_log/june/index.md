I took a break from the project working on a different one. It's finished, so I have more time to work on Latent Garden again. I realised I've been putting a lot of time into developing and customising neural networks. I set out to develop means of exploring the latent space of these networks, it's been long time since i've reminded myself of that. 

In the upcoming months I'll be focusing on the visual and interactive part of the represntation of a latent space. I'll be using existing neural networks and won't be putting a lot of time into customising them, for now.
