#### Artificial gallery

The first prototype represents the latent space as an artificial gallery where each room represents a segment of the latent space. Each room is a sample from the latent space. 

The network is mostly familiar with the samples from the center of the latent space. There's an infinite amount of rooms in this gallery, however farther out from the center the visitor ventures, the less recognisable images will they discover.
