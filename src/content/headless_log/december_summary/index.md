#### First person exploration

What if latent space is explored from inside? In December and January I created a prototype for first person navigation in the spirit of a shooter video game. There's a bug where the images farther back render over the ones in the front, I kept it as a visually interesting anomaly for now. 

I'm still using the generator trained on painted portraits for the demo above. To better show variety these neural networks can create I'm training a new network on custom data more varied data.
